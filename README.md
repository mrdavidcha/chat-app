# Welcome

This is a simple app built with [Remix.js](https://remix.run/docs) using ChatGPT's API that will answer all of life's questions. Try it out for yourself!

## Development

- You'll need your own ChatGPT api key.
  - Go to:  https://platform.openai.com/overview and create an account.
  - After account is created, go to "Manage Account" and "Create a new secret key".
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your newly created ChatGPT apikey like so (replacing SOME KEY GOES HERE):

```
API_KEY='SOME KEY GOES HERE'
```

From your terminal:

```sh
npm i
```

and

```sh
npm run dev
```
