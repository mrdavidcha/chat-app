# Welcome

This is a simple app built with [Remix.js](https://remix.run/docs) using ChatGPT's API that will answer all of life's questions. Try it out for yourself!

## Development

You'll need your own ChatGPT api key. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add ChatGPT key like so (replacing SOME KEY GOES HERE):

```
API_KEY='SOME KEY GOES HERE'
```

From your terminal:

```sh
npm i
```

and

```sh
npm run dev
```
